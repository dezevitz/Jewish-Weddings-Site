			<h2 class="mt-3 mb-4 position-relative content-title">Schedule </h2>
				The ceremony will be lead by both a Rabbi and an Imam. The ceremony will begin with a smaller group in the North Room
				and continue with a larger group in the courtyard.
				<h4>3:30pm- Mahr Begins</h4>
				<p>
					This will take place in the North Room. The groom will be presenting the bride with a financial
					offering. This money will become hers to spend exclusivly. In Islamic tradition, the Mahr ensures
					that the bride has some property. Abdul Ali will be acting as Miriam's Wali since her father will not be attending. The Wali's 
					job is to act as Miriam's guardian and give her up for marriage.
				</p>
				<h4>3:40pm- Nikah</h4>
				<p>
					During this part of the ceremony (still in the North Room), the bride and groom will be legally married
					under Islamic law. Abdul Ali will continue playing the role of Wali. At this time, Mohammad will propose
					to Miriam. She will respond with "qubool" ("I accept") three times. 
				</p>
				<h4>4:00pm- Nikah-Namah or Ketubah signing</h4>
				<p>
					Both Muslim and Jewish wedding ceremonies consist of a "wedding contract" that must be signed in the presence of
					two male witnesses. The witnesses for this ceremony will be Abdul Ali and Noam Swartz. Images of the wedding contract
					are avaliable in the portfolio section of the wedding website.
				</p>
				<h4>4:30pm- Beginning of Ceremony Under the Chuppah</h4>
				<p>
					At this point, the ceremony will move out of the North room to under the Chuppah in the courtyard (images of the 
					chuppah avaliable in the portfolio section of the website). Since the groom's parents will not be attending, Mohammed
					will be walked down the isle by Abdul Ali and Noam Swartz.  Female guest shall sit on the left side of the aisle, while
					men shall sit on the right side. 
				</p>
				<h4>4:40pm- Bedeken and Circling</h4>
				<p>
					Since Miriam's parents are unable to attend, Miriam will be escorted by her maid of honor, 
					Julie West, and bridesmaid, Casey Hoffman. Once at the end of the of the aisle, the groom will
					approach her for Bedeken, the veiling ceremony. The tradition of Bedeken comes from the Jewish Bible where
					Jacob was tricked into marrying his beloved Rachel's sister, Leah. The groom must double check to make sure 
					he is marrying the correct bride.
				</p>
				<p>
					After Bedeken, the groom takes his place under the chuppah once again, and then the Circling ritual begins.
					Miriam, with Casey and Julie by here side, will circle Mohammed, seven times. Traditionally, circling is a way for the bride 
					to create an invisible wall around the groom, “to protect him from evil spirits, from the glances of other women and from the 
					temptations of the world.” 
				</p>
				<h4>4:50pm- Giving of Rings Ceremony</h4>
				<p>
					The bride and the groom have decided on a double ring ceremony, meaning both the bride and the groom will offering
					and accept a ring. They chose this type of ceremony because they wanted to have some since of equality in their relationship
					and a double ring ceremony shows they are both giving and taking. The will recite the phrase "I am my beloveds and my beloved is mine"
					to further emphasize this equality.
				</p>
				<h4>4:55pm- The Seven Blessings</h4>
				<p>
					The bride and the groom will together recite the seven blessing over a glass of wine. The seven blessing are an important
					Jewish Ritual because it recalls the main teaching of the Jewish Bible. The groom will be reciting the English Translation,
					while the bride will be reciting the Hewbrew translation. The seven blessing are as follows:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Blessed are You, Adonai our God, Ruler of the Universe, Creator of the fruit of the vine. </li>
					<li>Blessed are You, Adonai, our God, Ruler of the universe, Who has created everything for your glory.</li>
					<li>Blessed are You, Adonai, our God, Ruler of the universe, Creator of Human Beings.</li>
					<li>Blessed are You, Adonai, our God, Ruler of the universe, Who has fashioned human beings in your image, according to your likeness and has fashioned from it a lasting mold. Blessed are You Adonai, Creator of Human Beings. </li>
					<li>Bring intense joy and exultation through the ingathering of Her children (Jerusalem). Blessed are You, Adonai, are the One who gladdens Zion (Israel) through Her children’s return. </li>
					<li>Gladden the beloved companions as You gladdened Your creatures in the garden of Eden. Blessed are You, Adonai, Who gladdens this couple. </li>
					<li>Blessed are You, Adonai, our God, Ruler of the universe, Who created joy and gladness, loving couples, mirth, glad song, pleasure, delight, love, loving communities, peace, and companionship. Adonai, our God, let there soon be heard in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem the sound of joy and the sound of gladness, the voice of the loving couple, the sound of the their jubilance from their canopies and of the youths from their song-filled feasts. Blessed are You Who causes the couple to rejoice, one with the other. </li>
				</ol>
				<h4>4:55pm- Fatihah</h4>
				<p>
					The imam will be reading the first verse of the Quran to wish the couple good luck. 
					Here is an exerpt of the text that will be read:
				</p>
				<p>
					In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful: All Praise is due to Allah, Lord of the Universe
					The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Owner of the Day of Judgement. You alone do we worship, and You alone we turn to for help
					Guide us to the straight path; The path of those on whom You have bestowed your grace, not (the way) of those who have earned Your anger, nor of those who went astray.
				</p>
				<h4>5:09pm- Breaking of the glass</h4>
				<p>
					During this period, both the bride and the groom will stomp on a glass wrapped in napkin. This is a staple at a Jewish wedding
					representative of how fragile love is and how it needs to be taken care of. 
				</p>
				<h4>5:15pm- Savaqah</h4>
				<p>
					After breaking the glass, the bride will be showered with coins as the ceremony ends. This is considered good luck and wealth in Muslim culture.
				</p>
				<h4>5:20pm- Yichud</h4>
				<p>
					Before the celebration and feast, the bride and the groom will take 8 minutes for themselves in a private room. 
					This is typically where a couple would touch for the very first time. Even though Miriam and Mohammad have a close intimate relationship,
					they still wanted to have this moment to calm down and share the happiness of the ceremony together.
				</p>
				<h4>5:28pm- Walima/Wedding Reception!</h4>
				<p>
					The bride and the groom return to the courtyard once again to begin the celebration! There will be food, music, and 
					dancing for hours! Congratulations Miriam and Mohammed!
				</p>
